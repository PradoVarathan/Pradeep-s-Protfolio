Currently working on the research aspects of combining multiple frameworks of deep learning to provide a pipeline that can enable individual level prediction of disease using genomic data. As a first step, I have created a pipeline using DeepSEA framework and have a complete repository for the tool and description in my Github profile under the name C-SHAL. It enables the relation of GWAS variants and their probability in affecting the functional properties of the chromatin features.

In moving forward, I am concentrating on using the mulitple transformers to increase the efficiency of the learning pipelines and also creating a much user-friendly softwares for individual genomic analysis.
