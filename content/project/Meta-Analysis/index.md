Implementing meta-analysis enabled to extract the potential research papers and journals
published in bioactive compounds isolated from mangrove ecosystem. The meta-analysis
of bioactive compounds was initiated with a focus inclined to keywords using the
search words: ‘Bioactive compounds’, ‘Mangrove’, ‘gene OR drug’ in WoS, SCOPUS
and PubMed to screen the available research in major research publishers such as Elsevier,
Taylor and Francis, Emerald, Springer, Wiley and articles to date. The data of papers
published as articles in journals were selected and patent paper, review article, conference
proceedings were eliminated. Total of 86 and 54 papers was analyzed in SCOPUS, 117 and
41 papers were found to be prominent from WoS and PubMed could generate 38 and 20
papers using two sets of key words . The obtained data were examined in BibExcel
and R studio.
