abstract: The mangrove ecosystem is one of the wealthiest organic and salt containing ecosystem. It has a large biomass consisting of bacteria, fungi, plants and other potential organisms. The recent boom in the discovery of bioactive compounds from the mangrove ecosystem is a potential minefield to inspect for potential drug molecules for various diseases. Meta-analysis offers potential to reveal intrinsic observations from large-scale data. The data that obtained from literature meta-analysis decode the high-throughput results that were mapped. Focusing on the usage of a more stringent method of meta-analysis to elucidate the bioactive compounds from the mangrove ecosystem a total of 365 research articles were analysed here and promised potent drug molecules to isolate from mangrove environment. Meta-analysis was carried using software BibExcel and R program. A total of eight research articles exclusively focused on bioactive compounds as a drug candidate to treat neurodegenerative disease. This article will construct a holistic approach to analyze and explore the vast field of bioactive compounds in the mangrove ecosystem. A systematic review by bibliometric analysis is a streamline method to find out lead molecules as a therapeutic drug molecule to multiple diseases, out of which this review attempts to cover the neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, BibExcel and R program can be implemented in any research field to examine the structure and development undertaken to date.
